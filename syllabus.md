**Prereqs.:** TE 299

**Description:**

Course focuses on contemporary issues and emerging topics in STEM Education.  
Specifically, this iteration of the course covers: common coding curricula that you may teach and/or use for TE class projects, the core computing & networking concepts required to support coding-related projects, open educational resources/open source software & hardware, growth mindset, honing & teaching computational thinking/algorithmic thinking through coding projects. This is a 3-cr course, which means that, according to the federal guidelines, you can expect on average approximately 6 hours of work outside of the classroom, plus attendance time in class, your mileage may vary, particularly given the newness of this course \(and pending your prior experience with coding\). Either way, I want you to be able to stretch, learn, and grow, both in support of the projects that you may create and in terms of your role as educators-in-training. We need to be collaborative, as coding is a co-creative process. The speed with which this technology changes means that no one person can expect to be an expert in all things “computers” or code. As such, we will take an open source software approach to our work - sharing solutions and improvements with one another. Instead, knowing where to look for help and helping one another will be the core skills that will allow you \(and the whole class\) to be successful.

**Absence policy:**

It is key to everyone’s success that you come to class and engage with the instructor and - most importantly - with your classmates. We know that all students do better when they are physically here and focused in class. We only have 28 days together, including the dates of our exams \(26 working days\), so each one matters. As such, you may have no more than 2 unexcused absences if you want to pass this class. You may have up to 2 others \(but you will need to send me an email to say why & bring proof of the need for your absence, such as doctor’s notes or an obituary\). Additionally, your level of class participation will be graded. Please note the grading / assessment method.

**What you have to buy:**

* I do not require a textbook. I have brought together many resources - both all rights reserved but free for you to use in this course and openly licensed materials. I have created materials to fill in gaps in order to reduce the costs of this course to you \(& also because this technology is fast-moving\).  \(More on copyright & licensing in our first class meeting\)
* You must purchase a Raspberry Pi that will be brought into class for work and will be used as the basis for configuration assignments, the recommended \(tech supportable by your instructor\) version would be to order: 
  * The newer Raspberry Pi 4B or Raspberry Pi 3B / 3B+ will be ideal & is what the lessons are based on. RPi Zero may not work or you may require your own investigations to make it work. Please see the details of purchasing at [https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/faqs/\#buying](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/faqs/#buying). The base cost of just the board \(no power charger, cable for monitor, keyboard, mouse, case, or mini-SD card\). It is possible that you will have to upgrade your operating system and/or software packages, but troubleshooting these issues will be part of the learning process. Brand new, with none of the needed extras the board only costs $35. You will also need a power cable & a micro SD card. To run the little machine at home, you’ll also want: cables \(HDMI if RPi 3B/4B or mini HDMI & USB OTG for R Pi Zero\); the actual monitor & the keyboard & mouse. You can buy a whole kit with basics & extras for more through such sites as Vilros or Canakit. 
  * To set up your Raspberry Pi, you will need:
    * Power cable / charger, compatible with the Pi
    * a micro-SD card for the operating system
    * cable for display/monitor \(e.g., HDMI\)
    * keyboard 
    * mouse
    * A monitor
    * wired / wireless networking, if you want this computer to be online
    * \(optional\) a Pi case \(alternatively, you may 3d print a case or try out the cardboard punnet case plans at [https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6424](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6424) - may need modification\)
  * We need the Pis to be received by the time we begin our section on computing \(Weeks 2 to 3\).
* I’ve expended considerable time trying to ensure that this is a low-cost \(& as open as possible a\) course for you. If you have problems affording your Pi, however, please let me know. 

**Core resources:**

* This is a course for “coding” and the teaching thereof which is - by its nature **-** computer-intensive. As such, you need to arrange to use computers for your assignments. If this is going to be a problem for you or you need help with this, please let me know. \(Please see the section on Disability rights and let me know at the outset of the course if there are special accommodations / adaptations that you will require.\)
* You will need a jump drive. If this is a problem, please let me know. 
* Raspberry Pi \(see What you have to buy\)
* I have posted resources online. They will be linked through the online site on GitHub. If they are “all rights reserved” materials, they will be available through a closed site such as the digital reserves on CentralSearch or Blackboard, but you will be linked to them & must then login with your Bluenet id / password. Additionally, some materials may be physically handed out \(you need to be in class!\)
* I will require you to use the following tools online \(if you have any problems with this, please let me know\): Github, Gitter, Scratch \(MIT\), AppInventor, potentially several online coding interfaces
  * On your local machines, you will need:
    * a git client
    * a text editor or an IDE for html, css, javascript, python

**Getting help:**

* Gitter room - instructor or classmates \(see notes on extra credit\). Follow common sense guidelines for civility \(e.g., in alignment with the GitHub Community’s “Code of Conduct” - e.g., [https://github.community/t5/Welcome/Code-of-Conduct/m-p/65\#M37](https://github.community/t5/Welcome/Code-of-Conduct/m-p/65#M37)\)
* Call or email instructor \(some weekends, the instructor reserves the right to be absent / away from email\). On days / dates where the instructor may be away for a conference, she will schedule a substitute instructor, which may slightly change the order of lessons.
* There are specific online communities and sites that can help you with coding and Raspberry Pi challenges. Follow their instructions on etiquette \(e.g., Stack Overflow, see such guidelines as this question checklist - [https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/260648/stack-overflow-question-checklist](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/260648/stack-overflow-question-checklist)\)
* Do not plagiarize or game the system of assessment. Feel free to adapt existing code, as long as you are learning from your work. Participation and doing the work will make it easy for you to get a decent grade in this course. Violating academic conduct and student behavior standards will lead to failing the course and possible additional measures - see: Academic Integrity / Misconduct section.

**Disclaimer:**

* Pending the class’ literacy in and/or preference for focus on certain topic areas, we may change the order and content of assignments. This class has never been run before, so you will help to co-create it. This is called an open pedagogical / open educational practices-based approach. As such, there will be an evolution of the exact content. This also means that “version control” will be important - you need to turn to the class’ github site for the latest version of the syllabus

**Learning Objectives / Goals:**

* Despite the potential changes to this syllabus, the following are the goals / objectives of this course. By the end of this course, students:
  * Will demonstrate how to add coding, computational thinking, and the growth mindset to their own teaching / projects in engineering technology education
  * Will understand and know how to use core vocabulary, concepts, and techniques for computing and coding at a level appropriate for engineering technology educators
  * Will be able to find the necessary resources to create and support coding-related projects and lessons
  * Will be able to describe what constitute open licensing and distinguish some of the key benefits & challenges to “open” as an approach to educational resources & techniques, hardware, and software

**Grading / Assessment:**

There will be many points of self-assessment & a number of summative assessments of literacy on technical topics that we cover. I encourage you to follow the assignments. Memory is enhanced by regular exercises & self-tests, which will be part of your assignments. At the same time, the purpose of this course is not to make you the best possible coder \(though it would be great if you achieved that\). It is to learn how to work with code and teach enough coding to your students to enhance core skills and/or to "hack" or "make" code-enhanced projects. How much you learn and how deeply you learn the code is up to you, but by the end of this course, having done the work, you should have enough of a foundation to be a “hacker” in the best possible sense. You will have foundational knowledge that allows you to troubleshoot basic computing, networking, web coding, and other coding issues. You will learn where you can get resources, learn what you need, and get the help that you need from communities of practice in the code world. Your participation improves this course, so this is a positive opportunity for co-creation.

**Academic Integrity Statement**

**see:** [**https://www.ccsu.edu/academicintegrity/**](https://www.ccsu.edu/academicintegrity/)

“At Central Connecticut State University we value personal integrity as fundamental to our interactions with each other. We believe that one of the purposes of a University education is for students learn to think critically, to develop evaluative skills, and to express their own opinions and voices. We place special weight on academic honesty in all of our intellectual pursuits because it is a value that is fundamental to academic life and scholarly practice. All members of the University community are obligated to uphold high standards of academic honesty in their scholarship and learning. Therefore, we expect students to take personal responsibility for their intellectual work and to respect and acknowledge the ideas of others. Academic honesty means doing one's own work and giving proper credit to the work and ideas of others. It is the responsibility of each student to become familiar with what constitutes academic dishonesty and plagiarism and to avoid all forms of cheating and plagiarism.

“According to the Student Code of Conduct and Statement of Judicial Procedures, academic misconduct “includes, but is not limited to, providing or receiving assistance from another, in a manner not authorized by the instructor, in the creation of work to be submitted for academic evaluation \(including papers, projects and examinations\).

“Plagiarism is defined as presenting as one’s own, the ideas or words of another person, for academic evaluation, without proper acknowledgment. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to: \(i\) copying sentences, phrases, paragraphs, tables, figures, or data directly or in slightly modified form from a book, article, or other academic source without using quotation marks or giving proper acknowledgment to the original author or source; \(ii\) copying information from Internet Web sites and submitting it as one’s own work; \(iii\) buying papers for the purpose of turning them in as one’s own work; and \(iv\) selling or lending papers to another person for submission by that other person, for academic evaluation, as his or her own work.”

**How does this work in an open source coding class?**

In this classroom, it’s crucial that when you are writing papers / projects / lesson plans, that you carefully cite all of the places from which you have gotten project ideas and step-by-step directions. If you are compiling resources, you need to make certain that they are openly licensed, as I will check them. If, for some reason, you see no openly licensed options, you will need to either create your own list of steps / documentation or simply point out / link to the copyright / all rights reserved materials. Part of this course is about learning to distinguish between those materials that you are free to compile with your own work \(& how to cite that\) and those that cannot be used in this way. Adding your own openly-licensed work to the “commons” of knowledge when there is only a proprietary option will be looked upon favorably, so you should point out that you have done so in your project write-up. A big caution here is that our classroom’s github may be open to the public. You not only must be concerned in following these rules of academic integrity to ensure that you are not in violation of the university’s policies, but you may be subject to a copyright infringement lawsuit. If you have questions, you can talk with me about this further by appointment / office hours or via email \(although I reserve the right to be away certain weekends\).
